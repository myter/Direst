AmbientTalk DSL tailored towards handling distributed and replicated state reactively.
# Getting Started
The DSL is provided as an AmbientTalk eclipse project.
Using the language and running the examples requires the AmbientTalk plugin for eclipse.
A tutorial on AmbientTalk and the plugin can be found at: https://code.google.com/archive/p/ambienttalk/wikis/EclipsePlugin.wiki
Note: the plugin is only supported for Eclipse versions until Juno (Eclipse 4.2)
